Invoice Application

Overview

This Invoice Application allows users to create and manage invoices seamlessly. It utilizes Firebase for authentication and Firestore for real-time data updates, providing a robust and responsive user experience.

Features

Firebase Authentication: Secure user authentication using Firebase, enabling users to log in and manage their invoices easily.
Firestore Integration: Instead of setting up a separate server for mock API requests, Firestore is used to store and retrieve invoice data. This approach allows for real-time updates and seamless integration with Firebase authentication.
Create Invoice Page: Users can input details to create new invoices. The application captures all relevant information and stores it in Firestore.
Technologies Used
React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
Firebase: Authentication and database services.
Firestore: Real-time NoSQL database for storing invoice data.
